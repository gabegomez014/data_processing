Projects:

1.) Pulsar Star: 98% complete
    The point of this project is to see if we can predict whether or not the readings from a star classify it as a pulsar star or not.
    
        Status: This project is mostly done. All that's left is to complete the Keras model.
        Model with Best Results: Random Forest Classifier
            Accuracy: 98.0% (Not super reliable since most cases are 0)
